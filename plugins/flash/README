This is the collection of source code files used in the FLASH hydro code for driving turbulence or generating turbulent initial conditions.

- StirFromFileMain is the turbulence driving module (this would replace the "StirMain/FromFile" directory in the public FLASH source tree).
- StirICsMain is the module that generates turbulent initial velocity and/or magnetic fields (if needed).
- legacy_fortran uses the old Fortran-only based driving method; should not be used; just here for reference.
